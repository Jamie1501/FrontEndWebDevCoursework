### `Changes made from Original Design`

The original design of the application was based on making a fullstack app with a frontend and backend. After starting and making progress on this method i decided to change as i was getting too many errors and was struggling to make the app the way originally planned. Therefore i focussed more on working with react and the front end to better my knowledge and thats why the design has been fully changed. Also making sure to stick to the idea of a single page application as mentioned on the brief.

The new design is based on what i learned in the labs and taking inspiration from the original plan to make a more functional app. The Original plan was to have a grid system with 3 columns and however many rows are needed for the recipes inputted. Now the grid system is a singual list of accordions which look similar to the grids and overall provide a better experience to mobile and tablet users as well. Also the filter by ingredients list is now always displaying as opposed to being behind a drop down box as there were issues with placement using the drop down. The navigation section is also changed as i have focussed on the idea of a single page application as mentioned in the brief therefore there is no longer a navbar and is more linear and easier to use on mobile and tablet as well. With this however the login system has been removed as it was causing too many problems and hindering progress overall. Finally, i wasnt going to add a graph to better view the nutritional information however after removing the login system it felt like a good additional feature to add therefore the nutritional info will display in a list of text and beneath that will be the graph. 

Overall recreating the app based on what we learned during the labs helped gain a much better understanding of react.
